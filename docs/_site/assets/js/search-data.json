    "content": "It can be tempting to use a setting in your service provider, to store things like service credentials that are needed to set it up. However, the settings package isn’t ready to use until the application is fully booted, since it depends on things like cache, encryption and its own bindings to function. If you try to use it before the application is booted, you’ll get an exception. To work around this, so you can use settings to set up services needed by the rest of your app, you can use the booted callback on the application. In the register function of your service provider, define a callback which should be called after the application is booted. This will be called as soon as the application is booted, meaning you can do any service setup here and make use of the settings. The easier option is to register your bindings as a callback, which should only be called once the service is actually requested. But either option is equally fine and you can use whichever suits the situation best! . ",

For some sites, the settings will depend on the team a user is in, the module you’re operating in, or the country you’re in. When creating a setting, you can assign it to be of one type.

To use your custom type, simply create a new setting class that extends your type. This replaces the user or global setting class you usually extend. If you use anonymous settings you can’t extend this class. Instead, you should create the type in your service provider as follows. public function boot() { \\Settings\\Anonymous\\AnonymousSettingFactory::mapType( // The key to refer to the type as 'team', // Return the current team ID, or null if there is no team. This will be used to filter the settings. fn() =&gt; \\App\\Team\\Resolver::hasCurrentTeam() ? \\App\\Team\\Resolver::currentTeam()-&gt;id() : null ); } . This can then be used when registering the anonymous setting. Instead of \\Setting\\Setting::createGlobal or createUser, simply call \\Setting\\Setting::create(team: 'team', ...); and pass through the type key as the first argument. If the setting type is only going to be used in one setting and you don’t want to create a type, you can just implement the resolveId function directly in your setting, or pass it into the create function as the resolveIdUsing function. The type can be anything you want and won’t be used. public function boot() { \\Settings\\Setting::create( 'team', // Although you still have to define a type, it doesn't mean any thing and doesn't have to exist.

    "content": "Permissions . You can control who can update and read specific settings. By default anyone can update or read any settings. If you want to limit this for added protection, you can add a canWrite and canRead function to class-based settings. These take no arguments and should return a boolean. public function canRead(): bool { return Auth::check() &amp;&amp; Auth::user()-&gt;can('read-this-setting'); } public function canWrite(): bool { return Auth::check() &amp;&amp; Auth::user()-&gt;can('write-this-setting'); } . We will take care of ensuring a user has permission before they update a setting. Form Field . Form fields are defined using the form schema generator. This allows you to define the form field to update the setting alongside the rest of the setting definition, then automatically create settings pages for your users. You can define any field you need here, including complex fields. The input name for the field is defined in $this-&gt;key(), and the default value in $this-&gt;defaultValue(). When using anonymous settings, hardcode the key and value and just pass the result of the field generator directly to ::create. // app/Settings/Class.php public function fieldOptions(): ?\\FormSchema\\Schema\\Field { return \\FormSchema\\Generator\\Field::textInput($this-&gt;key())-&gt;setValue($this-&gt;defaultValue()); } // ServiceProvider.php \\Settings\\Setting::createGlobal(..., fieldOptions: \\FormSchema\\Generator\\Field::textInput('mykey')-&gt;setValue('myvalue')) . If you omit this function, or this function returns null, your setting will not show up in automatically generated forms but it can be used everywhere else. This is recommended if you do not plan on using the form scheme generator elsewhere. Validation . To ensure the settings entered into the database are valid, you can define an array or string of Laravel rules in the rules method. If a setting is updated that does not match validation, a validation exception will be thrown and the setting not saved. There’s no need to put required/optional rules in, but do include nullable if the option can be null. public function rules(): array|string { return 'string|min:2|max:20'; } . Groups . Groups are a way to order settings to the user. By grouping together similar settings (such as those related to the site theme, authentication, emails), it helps users quickly find what they’re looking for. The group function should return an array of groups the setting is in. When retrieving a form schema to represent settings, the first group will be taken as the ‘main’ group. public function group(): array { return ['branding', 'appearance']; } . To further pad out your settings page, you can add a name and description to any group in your service provider. \\Settings\\Setting::registerGroup( 'branding', // Group Key 'Branding', // Title for the group 'Settings related to the site brand' // Description for the group ); . Encryption . To protect sensitive settings in the database, values can automatically be encrypted and decrypted for you. You can mark a setting as sensitive by adding a $shouldEncrypt property to the setting class. protected boolean $shouldEncrypt = true; . Encrypting and decrypting add very little overhead, so you may automatically encrypt all settings unless otherwise specified. To do this, set encryption to false in the config file. Anonymous settings use this behaviour to determine whether they should be encrypted. // config/laravel-settings.php return [ ..., 'encryption' =&gt; [ 'default' =&gt; false ] ] . Complex data types . All values in the database are automatically serialised to preserve type. This means that arrays and objects will all be saved and retrieved in the correct format, so you can always retrieve the value of a setting exactly the same as it was when you set it. All primitive types can be serialized already so you don’t need to worry about this. If you want to save a complex object and control how it is saved in the daabase, you can implement the \\Settings\\Contract\\CastsSettingValue interface on your setting. You will need to define a castToString and castToValue functions on the setting which will convert your validated setting value to a database-friendly string and back. This example would handle a complex data object, such as something returned from an API client. /** * Turn the API result into a string that can be saved in the database */ public function castToString(\\My\\Api\\Result $value): string { return json_encode([ 'id' =&gt; $value-&gt;getId(), 'result' =&gt; $value-&gt;getResult() ]); } /** * Turn the string back into an instance of the API result class */ public function castToValue(string $value): \\My\\Api\\Result { $value = json_decode($value, true); return new \\My\\Api\\Result($value['id']) -&gt;setResult($value['result']); } .

Then, delete the anonymous setting creation function call in your service provider. You can alias a setting through config or the service provider, or define it directly on your setting class. You only need to use one of the following methods. // config/settings.php return [ 'aliases' =&gt; [ 'site_name' =&gt; \\App\\Setting\\SiteName::class, ... ] ]; . // app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php public function boot() { settings()-&gt;alias('site_name', \\App\\Setting\\SiteName::class); \\Settings\\Setting::alias('site_name', \\App\\Setting\\SiteName::class); } . // app/Settings/SiteName.php public function alias(): ?string { return 'site_name'; } .

Note you must pass an axios instance to the Settings plugin. This must be ready to make api calls - if you are using the standard Laravel template this is set up for you and bound to window.axios, so the above snippet will work. Eager load settings You should also add the \\Settings\\Http\\Middleware\\ShareSettingsWithJs middleware to your web group in app/Http/Kernel.php. protected $middlewareGroups = [ 'web' =&gt; [ ... \\Settings\\Http\\Middleware\\ShareSettingsWithJs::class, ], ]; .
